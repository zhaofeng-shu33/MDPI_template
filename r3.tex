	Thanks for your careful review of my manuscript. According to my understanding, your major
	questions can be divided in the following categories:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item A better organization of the manuscript for general readers;
		\item How the current work is related with and distinguished from the preprint for the case of two
		communities.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	For the first question, I am sorry this manuscript is not friendly to general readers as its main results
	are presented in mathematical way. I have made some efforts to make it readable. For example, using
	Figure 2 to illustrate Theorem 1 and putting all proofs in a separate section. I will try to add some
	explanatory contents if details of hard parts can be provided.
	
	For the second question, I mentioned the preprint in the section of Related Works. To make it more clear,
	I think this work and the preprint have some overlap when only 2 community case is concerned.
	However, the preprint investigates the sample complexity problem for 2 community SBM while in this article,
	the phase transition is put at the most important question.
	The mathematical techniques used to establish phase transition in this article are derived from the preprint, but we obtain stronger
	results by more careful analysis.
	Moreover, we conduct numerical simulation in this work to verify the phase transition, which is absent in the preprint.
	
	Besides the similarity, this manuscript considered multiple community case and parameter estimation problem, which, as far as we know, 
	are new results.
