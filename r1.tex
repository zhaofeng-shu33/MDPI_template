	Thanks for your careful review of my manuscript. Below is my reply to each point of your question.
\begin{itemize}
\item Please improve description of "community detection" and the meaning of "exact recovery". Unless one already works in this field it is not easy to understand from the current introduction.

\item Please improve description of "community detection" and the meaning of "exact recovery". Unless one already works in this field it is not easy to understand from the current introduction.

\item My main problem with the paper is the language, and probably som minor errors, which makes it hard to follow parts of the ms. For example, definition 2 seems to be missing an essential part: "If there exists...such that" but there is no "then" part to describe what is defined. 

\item On line 109 the authors mention the "ground truth label vector", what does this mean? Is X always a ground truth label vector? 

\item The figure on page 4 is missing the powers of 10 on the y-axis.

\item On line 131-132 the use of repulsive and attractive looks strange, should it be repellent (or repelling) and attracting? On line 217 and in Algorithm 1, what does disassortative mean?

\item At the bottom of page 6 the "almost 1" should perhaps be "almost surely"?

\item Lemma 2: Umlauts missing on Erdos.

\item Lemma 6: The ending of the first sentence looks strange, perhaps from defining |I| and using it at once. Split it up?

\item Sentence at top of page 14: "Under such condition..." has a period after the formula, should probably be a comma.
\end{itemize}
Besides, I have revised my manuscript to improve its English style.
